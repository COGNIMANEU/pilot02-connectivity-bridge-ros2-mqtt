# Pilot02 Connectivity Bridge ROS2 MQTT

This repository contains a docker based version of the https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/mqtt_client package that acts as a bridge between ROS2 topics and MQTT channels.

## Description

The repository includes the following components:
- Configuration files (how to address the bridge from ROS->MQTT and MQTT->ROS)
- Launch files 
- Docker setup for easy containerization
- A Docker Compose-based test environment to verify end-to-end functionality: ROS publisher ‚Üí MQTT bridge ‚Üí MQTT broker ‚Üí Python MQTT client; Python MQTT client ‚Üí MQTT broker ‚Üí MQTT bridge ‚Üí ROS subscriber.

## Guidelines for build and test the component 

### 1. **Build the Main Docker Image:**

In this step, we build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`. The image is named `pilot02-connectivity-bridge-ros2-mqtt`.

```bash
docker build -t pilot02-connectivity-bridge-ros2-mqtt .
```
Make sure the path to your configuration and launch files is correctly mapped to the Docker container.

### 2. **Run the ROS 2 Container:**

After building the Docker image, you can run the container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -e LAUNCH_FILE=your_custom_launch_file.py -e CONFIG_FILE=your_custom_config_file pilot02-connectivity-bridge-ros2-mqtt
```

This will start the container and launch the MQTT bridge with the configuration given.

### 3. **Build and Run the test automation:**

Test automation is integrated by docker-compose file:

Run: 
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

In case it works, you should see:

## Bridge configuration

Include your bridge configuration from ROS to MQTT and from MQTT to ROS, as well as the MQTT broker:

```yaml
/**/*:
  ros__parameters:
    broker:
      host: mqtt_broker
      port: 1883
    bridge:
      ros2mqtt:
        ros_topics: 
          - /ros_to_mqtt
        /ros_to_mqtt:
          mqtt_topic: to_mqtt
          primitive: true
      mqtt2ros:
        mqtt_topics: 
          - mqtt_to_ros
        mqtt_to_ros:
          ros_topic: /from_mqtt
          primitive: true
```
